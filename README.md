CALCULATOR
The Calculator project is a simple Java application that performs basic arithmetic operations using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project is designed to demonstrate the concepts of OOP such as classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

Features:
Basic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, Modulus.
Modular Design: Utilizes OOP principles for better code structure and maintainability.
Input Validation: Handles invalid input and edge cases gracefully.
Error Handling: Ensures safe division by zero and other potential issues.

Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/subash3650/Calculator.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd Calculator

Compile the Java files:
javac Calculator.java

Run the application:
java Calculator

How to Use
Run the program.
Select the arithmetic operation you want to perform (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division).
Enter two numbers.
The program will display the result of the operation.
Example
yaml
Copy code
Welcome to the OOP Calculator!
Please select an operation:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division

Inputs are entered in the expresion form 3*8/2

OOP Concepts Applied
Classes and Objects: The Calculator class contains methods for each arithmetic operation.
Inheritance: The program can be extended to support more operations through inheritance.
Encapsulation: Data and methods are encapsulated within classes, promoting modularity.
Polymorphism: Methods can be overridden to handle different types of operations.

Technologies Used
